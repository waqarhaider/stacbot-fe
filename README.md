Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `Change to use localhost BE API`

Chnage wherever "https://stacbot-be.onrender.com/" to "http://localhost:8000".

### `Deployment`

The deployment was completed using Vercel (https://vercel.com/).
Please use the department email for any future updates so the project does not need to be redeployed from scratch.
Alternatively, you may create a new Vercel account using your university email and redeploy the application if necessary.
